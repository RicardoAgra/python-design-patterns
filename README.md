## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the devision of a program into disctinct components which have limited interaction.
Advantages of Encapsulation:

-   Easier to test: Each component can be tested seperatly.

-   Modularization: New functionality can be developed based on the existing code base,
    wihtout the need to right extra code or duplicated code.

## Abstraction

Abstration means we should hide unnecessary details in our classes and objects in order to reduce complexity.
