## Concepts

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the devision of a program into disctinct components which have limited interaction.
Advantages of Encapsulation:

-   Easier to test: Each component can be tested seperatly.
-   Modularization: New functionality can be developed based on the existing code base, wihtout the need to right extra code or duplicated code.

### Abstraction

Abstration means we should hide unnecessary details in our classes and objects in order to reduce complexity.
The advantages are:

-   Less complexity when using the class due to a smaller API surface.

## Design Patterns

### Memento

The memento desing pattern solves the need to go back in the state of an application.
